# Multithreaded_Web_Server_Part2

Follow up to part 1 of the multithreaded web server project. Implemented utily functions provided in part 1

 To compile and run our program, with the terminal in the Template directory, one must 
 submit "make" and then "make test_full", followed by the prompted <socket> number to be
 used.  Once this is done, the server is up and running, ready for requests.

 To make a request, one must open a new terminal and enter the request, for example, "wget http://127.0.0.1:<socket>/testing/image/jpg/29.jpg".  Improper requests do not crash the server or end the process.
